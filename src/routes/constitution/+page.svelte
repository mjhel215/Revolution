    <h2 class="sectionHeading" bind:this={one}>League Rules and Regulations</h2>
    
    <p>All league rules and regulations were voted in by poll format by all initial members of the league. Any further changes shall be voted on by all currently paid and participating league members by poll format in the Sleeper platform in which league majority (with at least ten votes total) will win the poll. In chance of a tie, the league commissioner shall break the tie with a decision leaning towards best practice for all league members. </p>
      
    <h2 class="sectionHeading" bind:this={two}>League Platform</h2>
    
    <p>The current league format is twelve team Dynasty which will be run on the Sleeper platform. Team rosters will be kept by team owners year-round.</p>

    <h2 class="sectionHeading" bind:this={two}>League Fees and Payout</h2>

    <p>The league fee is $50 a year which will be paid in full before we begin our rookie draft. We will use the website Leaguesafe.com as our league bank. Commissioner of the league will release funds to winners as soon as Leaguesafe.com releases the funds upon the fantasy football season ending.</p>
    
    <p>Payouts are as follows: $400 for 1st, $150 for 2nd, $50 for 3rd. Winning payouts are based upon end of season championship playoff bracket outcome. Note: not top points team.</p>
    
    <h3 bind:this={twoThree}>2.3 Draft Day Trades</h3>
    <p>If a trade is being made during the draft, one or both parties can alert the commissioner to pause the draft to allow for extra time to negotiate the trade.</p>
    
    <h2 class="sectionHeading" bind:this={three}>Section 3 Scoring System</h2>

    <h3 bind:this={threeOne}>3.1 Scoring System</h3>
    <p>The league scoring system breakdown is listed on the Sleeper fantasy app (for the most part, it follows typical .5PPR Scoring). The scoring system will never change without a majority league vote.</p>
    
    <h2 class="sectionHeading" bind:this={four}>Section 4 Postseason</h2>
    
    <h3 bind:this={fourOne}>4.1 Playoffs</h3>
    <p>At the end of the season 6 teams will make the playoffs. The first round of playoffs will commence in week 15. Each team that wins their division and the 4 wild card teams that finish with the best records, will receive a playoff berth. The 2 teams that win their division will receive a bye week in the first round of the playoffs. Each playoff matchup will only last one week and the winner will advance. Week 18 will not be used.</p>
    
    <h3 bind:this={fourTwo}>4.2 Seeding Tiebreakers</h3>
    <p>If two teams finish with the same record the tiebreakers will go as followed:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Points For</li>
        <li>Head 2 Head Record</li>
        <li>Division Record</li>
        <li>Total Points Against</li>
        <li>Coin Flip</li>
        <li>Duel to the death</li>
    </ol>

    <h2 class="sectionHeading" bind:this={five}>Section 5 Tanking Policy</h2>
    
    <h3 bind:this={fiveOne}>5.1 League Tanking Policy</h3>
    <p>No team may intentionally leave starting roster spots empty. Any evidence of intentionally leaving roster spots empty in order to improve your draft position may be subject to punishment, including but not limited to the forfeiture of draft selections.</p>

    <h2 class="sectionHeading" bind:this={six}>Section 6 Replacing Managers</h2>
    
    <h3 bind:this={sixOne}>6.1 Removing Managers</h3>
    <p>Short of continuously failing to set a valid lineup, or confirmed collusion, no manager can be removed against their will. Participation, through the league chat, trade offers, and the waiver wire, is strongly encouraged but generally grounds for removal.</p>
    
    <h3 bind:this={sixTwo}>6.2 Replacing Managers</h3>
    <p>When a manager needs to be replaced, the commisiooners will try to find a suitable candidate with some connection to at least a portion of the existing managers. Priority will be placed on managers who are eager to take on a dynasty commitment and will be very active within the league.</p>
    
    <h3 bind:this={sixThree}>6.3 Replacement Incentive</h3>
    <p>In the event that a manager chooses to quit the league or is removed by a comissioner, an incoming manager is offered a 50% reductioon on their first year buy-in.</p>

    <h2 class="sectionHeading" bind:this={seven}>Section 7 League Finances</h2>
    
    <h3 bind:this={sevenOne}>7.1 League Dues</h3>
    <p>League dues are set at {dues}$. Dues are collected through <a href="https://www.leaguesafe.com/league/3949641">LeagueSafe</a> and collection will be sent out no later than the first of August. All managers must be fully paid up before the start of regular season. In the event that a manager fails to pay before the deadline, a 10% penalty will be addd to their payment and will go towards the payouts at the end of the year.</p>
    
    <h3 bind:this={sevenTwo}>7.2 Payout</h3>
    <p>League payout is structured as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1st place: {dues * 8}$</li>
        <li>2nd place: {dues * 3}$</li>
        <li>3rd place: {dues}$</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In the event that a manager was fined due to late payment, their extra fee will be added to the winner's payout. Similarly, if new managers come into the league and the payout is smaller, the difference will come out of the winner's prize.</p>
    
    <h3 bind:this={sevenThree}>7.3 Raising Dues</h3>
    <p>A ⅔ majority vote is required in order to raise league dues. In the event that a manager is no longer financially comfortable with the buyin, finding a co-manager to split the cost is reccomended.</p>
